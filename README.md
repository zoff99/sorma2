# Sorma<sup>2</sup> - Simple ORM(Android)<sup>2</sup>

It is based on the wonderful https://github.com/maskarade/Android-Orma by [FUJI Goro](https://github.com/gfx)
<br>
<br>
This is a rewrite in pure java, to generate most stuff you need and then add it to your project
either as a ```.jar file``` or as ```java source```.<br>
You still need to add ```sqlite-jdbc-3.50.3.0.jar``` to your project to use it.<br>
<br><br>
~~sadly [sqlite-jdbc](https://github.com/xerial/sqlite-jdbc) project decided that it needs ```slf4j-api jar``` (for no good reason).~~
this was solved by: https://github.com/xerial/sqlite-jdbc/pull/1178
<br><br>
see: https://github.com/xerial/sqlite-jdbc/issues/1094<br>

# Usage

create one file for each database table that you need.
<br>
create file for db table `Person` as `./gen/_sorm_Person.java`
<br>(don't worry it is not really Java, we just use the syntax here)
```Java
@Table
public class Person
{
    @PrimaryKey(autoincrement = true)
    public long id;
    @Column
    public String name;
    @Column
    public String address;
    @Column
    public int social_number;
}
```

now create the Java sources with the Java SORMA2 Generator. <b>you need at least java 17</b>.<br>
```bash
java -classpath ".:sqlite-jdbc-3.50.3.0.jar:sorma2.jar" \
  com/zoffcc/applications/sorm/Generator "gen"
```

your project is now ready to start.<br>
enter the generator directory:
```bash
cd ./gen/
ls -al
```

now move or copy all *.java files from the generator directory into your Android or Java project source tree
```bash
cd gen/
# remove class files
find . -name '*.class'|xargs rm -v
cp -av ./com /home/user/your/project/source/tree/
```

in your Java project you will need the `sqlite jdbc jar` and in your
Android project you will need `com.github.zoff99:pkgs_zoffccAndroidJDBC` from [jitpack.io](https://jitpack.io/#zoff99/pkgs_zoffccAndroidJDBC)

add this dependency to your `build.gradle` file

```
implementation 'com.github.zoff99:pkgs_zoffccAndroidJDBC:1.0.11'
```

Use the `sorma_generated.jar` (that is generated in the `gen` directory) and `sqlite-jdbc-3.50.3.0.jar` for the Java project.<br>
Check `TestSorma.java` for an Example usage.
